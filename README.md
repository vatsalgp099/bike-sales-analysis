## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed duplicates (`Alt + A + M`)
- Standardized gender values (Find & Replace: `F` → `Female`)
- Converted relevant columns to **Currency** format
- Added **IF statements** to categorize age brackets
- Created a working sheet to avoid modifying raw data

### 2. Data Analysis
- Built **Pivot Tables** for flexible aggregation
- Inserted recommended charts with axis titles and adjusted decimal points
- Fixed sorting issue in *Distance* column (Excel treated values as text; applied manual sorting)

### 3. Dashboard Creation
- Designed a clean dashboard layout
- Merged and centered headings
- Copied and aligned graphs using Shape Format
- Added **Slicers** via Pivot Chart Analyzer
